# The Night of Longing

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/381701116.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/381701116)

This exhibition of Japanese woodcuts and books of the Edo and Meiji periods (c.1600-1900) is based on the Fitzwilliam Museumâ€™s collection.

Subjects include lovers in literature and drama, couples enjoying sex or frustrated by desire, and figures yearning for absent partners, touched by the poetry of shared emotions from another time.

These pages were first created to accompany an exhibition that displayed most of this selection for the first time in the Fitzwilliam Museum from 1 October 2013 to 12 January 2014.
