> Longing for you on the  
  sleepless rocky waves of the bed  
  where once we loved and slept â€“  
  I stare pensively at the long rains  
  soaking my sleeves with tears.  

Fujiwara no Takamitsu's wife to her absent husband, 10th century.

This exhibition of Japanese woodcuts and books of the Edo and Meiji periods (c.1600-1900) is based on the Fitzwilliam Museum's collection.

Subjects include lovers in literature and drama, couples enjoying sex or frustrated by desire, and figures yearning for absent partners, touched by the poetry of shared emotions from another time.

These pages were first created to accompany an exhibition that displayed most of this selection for the first time in the Fitzwilliam Museum from 1 October 2013 to 12 January 2014.
